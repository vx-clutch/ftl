### Reverse Polish Notation
Reverse polish notation, also know as postfix, is a mathmatical notation system that places the operator after the operands. See Figure 1. as an example.

Figure 1.
```
3 4 *
```
This places a twelve at the top of the stack

### Stack Machine
FTL is based on a stack machine, which is a computation model that performs all operations on a stack. This works well with reverse polish notation, see [reverse polish notation](#reverse-polish-notation)
